**Introduction**

TeamCity is a popular continuous integration and deployment server. Securing TeamCity with SSL (HTTPS) is essential to protect data in transit, especially credentials and build artifacts.

This repository provides:

Â·       A **PowerShell script** to download SSL certificates from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), import them into a Java keystore (.keystore), and restart TeamCity.

Â·       A **GitHub Actions workflow** to automate this process securely using GitHub Secrets.

Â·       Clear guidance to help beginners and advanced users set up SSL for TeamCity efficiently.

**Why SSL for TeamCity?**

Â·       **Encrypts communication** between users and the TeamCity server.

Â·       Prevents **man-in-the-middle attacks**.

Â·       Enables **secure login and data transfer**.

Â·       Required for compliance with many security standards.

**Overview of This Project**

Â·       **Certificate Management:** Uses .pfx (PKCS\#12) certificates stored securely in Google Cloud Storage.

Â·       **Keystore Handling:** Imports .pfx into a Java keystore using keytool (standard Java tool).

Â·       **Service Management:** Safely stops and starts the TeamCity Windows service during updates.

Â·       **Automation:** Supports manual execution or fully automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

Â·       **Security:** Uses GitHub Secrets to handle sensitive passwords securely.

**Prerequisites**

Before you start, ensure you have:

Â·       A **TeamCity server** running on Windows.

Â·       **Java JRE/JDK** installed on the TeamCity server (for keytool).

Â·       Access to a **Google Cloud Storage bucket** for certificate storage.

Â·       A **GitHub account** and basic familiarity with repositories.

Â·       Installed **Git** and optionally **GitHub CLI** on your local machine.

Â·       Installed **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)** on the machine running the script or GitHub Actions runner.

**Step-by-Step Setup Guide**

**Generate or Obtain SSL Certificate (.pfx)**

You need a .pfx certificate file (PKCS\#12 format) which contains your SSL certificate and private key.

Â·       **Option 1: Purchase from a Certificate Authority (CA).**

Â·       **Option 2: Create a self-signed certificate for testing:**

Using PowerShell:

$cert \= New-SelfSignedCertificate \-DnsName "your.teamcity.domain" \-CertStoreLocation Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My  
 $pwd \= ConvertTo-SecureString \-String "YourPfxPassword" \-Force \-AsPlainText  
 Export-PfxCertificate \-Cert $cert \-FilePath "C:\\path\\to\\teamcity\_cert.pfx" \-Password $pwd

Replace "your.teamcity.domain" and "YourPfxPassword" accordingly.

**Upload Certificate to Google Cloud Storage**

1\.   	Install and initialize [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2\.   	Upload your .pfx file:

gsutil cp C:\\path\\to\\teamcity\_cert.pfx gs://your-gcs-bucket/teamcity\_cert.pfx

**Create GitHub Repository and Store Secrets**

1\.   	Create a new GitHub repository for your scripts.

2\.   	In the repo, go to **Settings \> Secrets and variables \> Actions**.

3\.   	Add the following secrets:

o   KEYSTORE\_PASSWORD: Password protecting your .pfx file and keystore.

o   GCP\_SA\_KEY: Your Google Cloud service account JSON key (for GCS access).

**Configure TeamCity for SSL**

Edit C:\\TeamCity\\conf\\server.xml and configure the HTTPS connector:

\<Connector port="443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"  
        	SSLEnabled="true"  
        	scheme="https" secure="true"  
            keystoreFile="C:\\TeamCity\\conf\\.keystore"  
            keystorePass="your-keystore-password"  
        	sslProtocol="TLS" /\>

**Run PowerShell Script Locally**

Run the PowerShell script with parameters:

.\\Install-TeamCitySSLCert.ps1 \`  
   \-GcsBucketName "your-gcs-bucket" \`  
   \-GcsCertObjectName "teamcity\_cert.pfx" \`  
   \-TeamCityConfDir "C:\\TeamCity\\conf" \`  
   \-TeamCityCertDir "C:\\TeamCity\\Cert" \`  
   \-KeystorePassword "\<your-keystore-password\>"

**Automate with GitHub Actions**

Create .github/workflows/deploy-teamcity-ssl.yml with:

name: Deploy TeamCity SSL

 on:  
   workflow\_dispatch:

 jobs:  
   deploy-ssl:  
 	runs-on: windows-latest

 	steps:  
 	\- uses: actions/checkout@v4

 	\- name: Setup Google Cloud SDK  
   	uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1  
   	with:  
     	project\_id: your-gcp-project-id  
     	service\_account\_key: ${{ secrets.GCP\_SA\_KEY }}  
     	export\_default\_credentials: true

 	\- name: Run SSL Deployment Script  
   	shell: pwsh  
   	env:  
     	KEYSTORE\_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE\_PASSWORD }}  
  	 run: |  
     	.\\Install-TeamCitySSLCert.ps1 \`  
       	\-GcsBucketName "your-gcs-bucket" \`  
       	\-GcsCertObjectName "teamcity\_cert.pfx" \`  
       	\-TeamCityConfDir "C:\\TeamCity\\conf" \`  
       	\-TeamCityCertDir "C:\\TeamCity\\Cert" \`  
       	\-KeystorePassword $env:KEYSTORE\_PASSWORD

**Understanding the PowerShell Script**

Â·       **Download Certificate:** Uses gcloud CLI to fetch .pfx from GCS.

Â·       **Keystore Import:** Uses keytool \-importkeystore to create or update Java keystore.

Â·       **Service Control:** Stops TeamCity service before import and restarts it afterward.

Â·       **Error Handling:** Throws detailed errors on failure for easy debugging.

**GitHub Actions Workflow Explained**

Â·       **Triggers:** Manual (workflow\_dispatch) to run on demand.

Â·       **Environment:** Windows runner with PowerShell.

Â·       **Google Cloud Setup:** Authenticates using service account key.

Â·       **Script Execution:** Runs your PowerShell script with secrets injected securely.

**Security Best Practices**

Â·       Never commit passwords or keys directly to your repository.

Â·       Use GitHub Secrets to manage sensitive data.

Â·       Limit service account permissions to only required scopes.

Â·       Use HTTPS and secure channels for all communications.

**Troubleshooting**

Â·       **keytool not found:** Ensure JAVA\_HOME is set on the runner or server.

Â·       **Permission errors:** Run PowerShell as Administrator.

Â·       **GCS access denied:** Verify service account permissions and secret correctness.

Â·       **TeamCity service fails to restart:** Check Windows service logs.

**FAQs**

**Q:** Can I use this for production?  
 **A:** Yes, but ensure certificates are from a trusted CA and secrets are handled securely.

**Q:** What if my keystore password differs from .pfx password?  
 **A:** The script assumes they are the same for simplicity; customize if needed.

**Q:** How do I update the certificate?  
 **A:** Upload new .pfx to GCS and rerun the script or workflow.
